#Hi! I'm a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India (MSRI), where I work on information-theoretic interpretations of privacy in machine learning, under the mentorship of Dr. <a href = 'https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/satya/'>Satya Lokam</a>. My primary research interests lie in the intersection of information theory, statistics, and learning theory.

Hi! I'm a Research Intern at Microsoft Research India (MSRI), where I'm advised by <a href = 'https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/satya/'>Satya Lokam</a>. My work focuses on rigorously quantifying the cost of privacy, communication, and memory constraints in statistical learning problems. 

I've also worked with Microsoft Research Cambridge to develop privacy-preserving solutions for financial applications, that later became part of the <a href = 'https://github.com/Sahamati/fiu-data-governance'> Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA)</a> standard in India. 

Prior to MSRI, I was an undergraduate intern in the Payments team at Amazon India. In my junior year, I served as a Research Assistant at Aalto University, where I worked at the intersection of decentralized exchanges and applied cryptography, after interning at the University of Turku, where I developed probabilistic models for missing data imputation in low-resource settings.

I am interested in addressing computational and statistical challenges that arise in modern machine learning and inference tasks, by applying tools and techniques from information theory, high dimensional statistics, and probability theory.
