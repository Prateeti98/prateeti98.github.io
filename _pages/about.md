#Hi! I'm a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India (MSRI), where I work on information-theoretic interpretations of privacy in machine learning, under the mentorship of Dr. <a href = 'https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/satya/'>Satya Lokam</a>. My primary research interests lie in the intersection of information theory, statistics, and learning theory. 

#My work focuses on rigorous quantification of privacy guarantees in machine learning, and the complexity of adaptive auditing strategies for differential privacy. My primary research in

Hi! I'm a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India (MSRI), where I'm advised by <a href = 'https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/satya/'>Satya Lokam</a>. My work revolves around the information-theoretic interpretations of privacy in machine learning, with a particular focus on deriving query-complexity lower bounds for adaptive attack strategies against private learners, and designing efficient online algorithms for differentially private synthetic data. More recently, I've been working with <a href='https://sinhagaurav.github.io/'>Gaurav Sinha</a> on identifying optimal soft interventions in causal bandits.

In the past, I've collaborated with Microsoft Research Cambridge and Ads teams on privacy-preserving computations for <a href = 'https://github.com/Sahamati/fiu-data-governance'>Trustworthy Data Governance</a>. Prior to MSRI, I was an intern at Amazon in the Payments division, and an Undergraduate Researcher at Aalto University, where I worked on blockchains and applied cryptography.

My research interests include differential privacy and causality, information theory, and online learning.
